**CodeCollab** is a platform dedicated to mutual support and collaboration between students of software engineering, ICT, 3IL, and any student with a passion for IT. It offers a space where students can share knowledge, solve programming problems together and develop their technical skills. The platform has the following features:

1. **Discussion forum**: Students can ask questions, share tips and discuss topics related to programming, programming languages, frameworks, development tools and more. They can also take part in discussions on specific topics and benefit from the experience of other members.

2. **Mentoring system**: More advanced students or software engineering professionals can sign up as mentors and offer their expertise to help beginner students. Mentors can give personalized advice, guide students through their projects and provide additional resources.

3. **Project collaboration**: Users can form teams and collaborate on programming projects. The application provides real-time code-sharing tools, enabling members to work together on the same project, solve programming problems and track code changes.

4. **Code library**: Students can contribute to a code library where they can share snippets, code examples and solutions for common programming problems. Users can search for reusable code and find solutions to their own programming challenges.

5. **Learning resources**: The application offers a selection of learning resources such as tutorials, articles, videos and online courses to help students improve their software engineering skills. Users can also recommend resources they have found useful.

6. **Events and competitions**: CodeCollab can organize online events such as hackathons, programming challenges and competitions, where students can practice their skills, win prizes and interact with other members of the community.
